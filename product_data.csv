A membrane is a very fine component (between 5 and 25 micrometers) affixed to the inside of a fabric that will prevent water from entering while letting moisture escape. While you stay warm in your boots, your feet will also stay dry. The outer sole and the mid-sole insulate from the cold contact with snow.', '      Breathable boots for optimal thermal comfort    ': ' Thermal comfort is a balance between the warmth of the boots and its ability to let the foot breathe. Too much heat or not enough breathability means that damp accumulates and cold can set in. We have designed your boots with your activity in mind, be it occasional or regular, with a membrane that prevents water ingress and lets damp out.', '      How can you be sure your boots are 100% waterproof?    ': ' We made sure that your boots are waterproof by conducting laboratory tests to simulate walking with the boots half submerged in water. We also conducted field tests to measure wear and aging. During the waterproofing test, we test 3 levels of waterproofing: 2,000 flexes (about 2.5-mile walk), 4,000 flexes (about 5-mile walk), and 8,000 flexes (about 10-mile walk). This model of boot has been tested for up to 4,000 flexes, which is equivalent to 5 miles of walking.', '      What is the difference between traction and grip?    ': ' The traction of the boots depends on the number and shape of the studs. The grip is dependent on the materials of the sole and the tread pattern, like the tires of your car. Traction optimizes propulsion, prevents the boot from slipping backward when going uphill, and stabilizes the boot. Grip prevents the boot from slipping and skidding on smooth ground or in demanding conditions (rain, snow, ice) by giving the base grip.', '      Which type of grip and traction does this boot provide?    ': ' Equipped with SNOWCONTACT soles, your boots are designed for maximum grip comfort for hiking and traction on snow. The location and height of the crampons (3 mm) are spaced strategically for optimal grip when hiking on snow. The surface and layout of the studs are designed to perfectly grip the layer of hard snow and evacuate excess water to avoid slipping.', '      How does the snowcontact technology used on the boot sole help you?    ': ' SNOWCONTACT soles are made with a specific component and stud pattern that is designed to ensure the best possible grip and traction. SNOWCONTACT soles are more effective than traditional soles on snow. When walking on ice, the only way to ensure optimum safety is to add anti-slip grips to your boots.', '      Will your boots withstand regular use over the long term?    ': ' Our engineers conduct laboratory tests to ensure that the product is fully satisfactory.
